All trades, swaps, or transactions you engage in are entirely initiated by you and are not solicited, recommended, or endorsed by the Server, its administrators, or moderators.
No investment advice or financial guidance has been provided to you by the Server, its administrators, moderators, or any affiliated party.
The Server does not review, assess, or verify the suitability, legitimacy, or value of any digital asset or trade.
We may allow discussions or share general information about tokens, projects, or market trends from third-party sources, community members, or automated tools. However, such content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial or investment advice.


Any token warnings, risk labels, or third-party insights shared in the Server do not imply an endorsement or guarantee of safety.

You are solely responsible for the custody and security of your digital asset wallets, including your private keys and seed phrases.
You should never share your wallet credentials, seed phrase, or private keys with anyone.
The Server, its administrators, and moderators do not assume any responsibility for your wallet’s security, functionality, or compatibility with any third-party services. We are not liable for any losses resulting from:

## Technical & Financial Knowledge


You confirm that you understand the inherent risks of blockchain technology and have sufficient knowledge to use digital assets, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and tokenized assets.
You are aware that anyone can create tokens, including fraudulent or misleading versions of legitimate assets.
Market Volatility & Trading Risks


You understand that digital asset markets are highly volatile due to factors such as adoption, speculation, regulatory changes, security vulnerabilities, and technological developments.
Stablecoins may not always remain stable and could experience de-pegging or liquidity crises.
Prices may fluctuate dramatically, and there is a risk of significant losses when swapping, trading, or holding assets.
Blockchain Transaction Risks


Transactions on blockchain networks are irreversible once confirmed.
Network congestion and gas fees may lead to delays or higher transaction costs.
Using advanced trading features (such as low-liquidity swaps) may expose you to slippage, higher costs, or unexpected losses.


## No Liability for Losses
You acknowledge that Blockchain Bazaar does not control the blockchain, smart contracts, or any financial protocols and is not responsible for any losses, errors, hacks, or exploits that occur while engaging in transactions.


By using the Server, you assume full responsibility for your actions and agree that Blockchain Bazaar and its administrators are not liable for any financial, technical, or regulatory risks associated with your transactions.

Blockchain Bazaar may contain reference or links to third-party resources, including but not limited to:


Information, materials, or educational content
External marketplaces, trading platforms, or blockchain tools
Third-party promotions, giveaways, or incentives
We do not own, control, monitor, endorse, or assume responsibility for any third-party resources or promotions shared within the Server.


By accessing or participating in such external resources or promotions, you acknowledge and agree that:


You do so at your own risk and must conduct your own due diligence.
This Agreement does not apply to your interactions with third parties, and the Server is not responsible for any issues arising from your participation.
Blockchain Bazaar and its administrators are not liable for any financial losses, scams, misleading claims, or security risks associated with third-party content.

## Entire Agreement
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Blockchain Bazaar regarding the use of its services. This Agreement supersedes any prior or concurrent written or oral agreements, discussions, or understandings related to the Server and its operations.


## Gas Fees
Blockchain transactions require network transaction fees (“Gas Fees”) to be paid to the respective blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana).


You are solely responsible for paying any Gas Fees for transactions you initiate.
Blockchain Bazaar does not collect, refund, or control Gas Fees, as they are determined by the blockchain network.
Gas Fees may vary depending on network congestion, transaction complexity, and other factors beyond our control.
We strive to minimize Gas Fees as much as possible by efficient transaction methods with lower fees when available.


The average time for completing a trade is approximately 10 minutes under normal network conditions.
However, in rare cases of high network congestion, smart contract delays, or security verification checks, transactions may take up to 2 business days to complete.
Blockchain Bazaar does not control network delays but strives to ensure most trades are completed within 10 minutes.


## Staking Terms & Conditions
Staking is entirely your decision. By depositing funds into our staking pool, you automatically accept these terms and agree to abide by them.


Currently, only USDT (BEP-20) is accepted for staking.
If you deposit any other token, it will be automatically converted to USDT (BEP-20), and an appropriate conversion fee will be charged.


Withdrawals can take up to 7 days to process under normal conditions.
In rare cases, external factors (such as network congestion or security audits) may affect withdrawal processing time.


Once processed, your withdrawn funds will be available in USDT (BEP-20) without any additional withdrawal fees.
If you wish to convert your withdrawn USDT to another token, an appropriate conversion fee will apply.


## Refund Policy
Once a trade is completed, it cannot be reversed under any circumstances.
Always double-check all details before finalizing your trade.


We do not support refunds or chargebacks after a transaction is completed.
All transactions are final and irreversible once executed on the blockchain.


A fixed refund fee ranging from $0.05 to $0.15 will be charged in addition to the applicable network gas fee.
## Eligibility for Refund


Refunds are only available if the funds have not been swapped on our end.
Once funds are swapped (typically within 20 seconds of reaching our wallet), refunds cannot be processed.


We reserve the right to charge an additional fee of up to 2.5% of the total swap volume in cases of high market volatility.
Responsibility of the User


It is your responsibility to ensure that you are sending the correct token on the correct blockchain network.
Sending tokens on the wrong chain or incorrect token type may result in loss of funds.
Refunds for such cases may incur additional recovery fees, depending on the token type and blockchain network involved.
